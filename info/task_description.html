    Our new calculator is censored and as such it does not accept some words.
    You should trick this thing and write a program to calculate the sum of numbers.
</p>

<p>
    Given a list of numbers, you should find the sum of numbers. Your solution should not contain any of the forbidden words
    (even as a part of another word).
</p>

<p>The list of forbidden words:</p>
<ul>
    <li>sum</li>
    <li>import</li>
    <li>for</li>
    <li>while</li>
    <li>reduce</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of numbers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sum of numbers.
</p>
